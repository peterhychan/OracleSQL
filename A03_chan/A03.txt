There are some specific rules for this assignment. 

    Each query uses only a single table
    If a task uses the English word "between"- it is the inclusive SQL key word Between.
    Because I want you to focus on the use of specific operators, for this assignment you may use only the following operators in the Where clause.
        Is Null
        Is Not Null
        In (list)
        Not In (list)
        Between exp1 And exp2
        Direction comparisons: =, !=,  >,   >=,   <,   <=

Specifically you may not use the Like operator or logical operators. If you use any of those operators in a query, you will receive no points for that task.

    Do not use the Group by clause; we have not yet discussed this in the notes.
    Remember, if a sample display is provided, use that to determine the column order and column aliases to use in your result set. The sample data will not generally match the data in your tables. Do not try to match the column widths of the sample displays shown here.
